# tractorlink

I realized how bad I was at programming when I tried to port the old "termlink" to windows, so here I am remaking it from the ground up. This is a program designed to replicate the Fallout series's terminal hacking minigame, with a large portion of personal touches.

## Building

`cmake . && cmake --build .`

It should work with just about any build system you have configured.
